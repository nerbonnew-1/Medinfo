As an expert software engineer please create an interactive Pyhon application to field and classify medical intents.

Objectives

  1.  Automated Classification: Use an LLM to classify patient inquiries as either Medical or Non-Medical based on predefined intent categories.

  2.  Intent Subtyping: Further categorize each inquiry into specific intent types (e.g., "Side Effects", "Product Access", "Affordability", "Dosage").

  3.  Static Response Mapping: Automatically return a pre-approved static response for each non-medical intent type.

  4.  Evidence-Grounded Medical Drafts: Generate draft responses for medical inquiries using Ibrance US Prescribing Information (PI) only.

  5.  Bias Monitoring and Mitigation: Ensure fair and equitable triage decisions across diverse patient language inputs and demographics.

  6.  Scalability Design: Build a modular system ready to expand to additional products, populations, and inquiry sources.

Technical Design
The solution will be developed in Python using Streamlit for rapid UI development. The proposed system consists of the following layers:

  1.  User Interface (Streamlit App):

  *   Text input field for the patient’s inquiry.  Utlize the intent_schema_approach.doc and the intent_training_dataset.csv.

  *   Output displays classification (Medical/Non-Medical/Unkown), intent type, system response, and confidence level.

  *   Feedback option for users to flag incorrect classifications or responses.

  2.  Preprocessing Layer:

  *   Normalizes incoming text (spelling, punctuation, etc.).

  *   Detects common informal or ambiguous phrasing typical in patient language.

  3.  Inference Engine (LLM):

  *   Uses an LLM GPT-4 to:

  *   Classify the inquiry as Medical or Non-Medical or Unknown.

  *   Determine the specific intent subtype using a predefined schema.

  *   Medical intents trigger a prompt to include USPI_Ibrance_palbociclib_capsules.md and USPI_Ibrance_palbociclib_TABLETS.md files to enhance the genai response.

  *   The LLM retrieves relevant excerpts and generates a grounded, compliant draft response.

  4.  Static Response Handler:

  *   Non-medical intents are linked to static responses from a configured response library (e.g., FAQs on cost or availability).

  *   These responses are instantly returned without needing to interact with the LLM.  

  5.  Post-Processing & Rule Layer:

  *   Applies rules based on keywords, confidence thresholds, and fallback logic.

  *   Ensures that critical medical intents (e.g., side effects) are never misclassified as non-medical.
