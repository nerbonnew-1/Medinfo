WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 
 
5.1 
Neutropenia 
 
Neutropenia was the most frequently reported adverse reaction in PALOMA-2 with an incidence of 80% 
and PALOMA-3 with an incidence of 83%.  A Grade ≥3 decrease in neutrophil counts was reported in 
66% of patients receiving IBRANCE plus letrozole in PALOMA-2 and 66% of patients receiving 
IBRANCE plus fulvestrant in PALOMA-3.  In PALOMA-2 and PALOMA-3, the median time to first 
episode of any grade neutropenia was 15 days and the median duration of Grade ≥3 neutropenia was 
7 days [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 
 
Monitor complete blood counts prior to starting IBRANCE therapy and at the beginning of each cycle, 
as well as on Day 15 of the first 2 cycles, and as clinically indicated.  Dose interruption, dose reduction, 
or delay in starting treatment cycles is recommended for patients who develop Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia 
[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 
 
Febrile neutropenia has been reported in 1.8% of patients exposed to IBRANCE across PALOMA-2 and 
PALOMA-3.  One death due to neutropenic sepsis was observed in PALOMA-3.  Physicians should 
inform patients to promptly report any episodes of fever [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. 
 
5.2 
Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis 
 
Severe, life-threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD) and/or pneumonitis can occur in patients 
treated with cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors, including IBRANCE when taken in 
combination with endocrine therapy. 
 
Across clinical trials (PALOMA-1, PALOMA-2, PALOMA-3), 1% of IBRANCE-treated patients had 
ILD/pneumonitis of any grade, 0.1% had Grade 3 or 4 and no fatal cases were reported.  Additional 
cases of ILD/pneumonitis have been observed in the postmarketing setting, with fatalities reported [see 
Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 
 
Monitor patients for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis (e.g. hypoxia, cough, 
dyspnea).  In patients who have new or worsening respiratory symptoms and are suspected to have 
developed pneumonitis, interrupt IBRANCE immediately and evaluate the patient.  Permanently 
discontinue IBRANCE in patients with severe ILD or pneumonitis [see Dosage and Administration 
(2.2)]. 
 
5.3 
Embryo-Fetal Toxicity 
 
Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, IBRANCE can cause fetal harm 
when administered to a pregnant woman.  In animal reproduction studies, administration of palbociclib 
to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis resulted in embryo-fetal toxicity at maternal exposures 
that were ≥4 times the human clinical exposure based on area under the curve (AUC).  Advise pregnant 
women of the potential risk to a fetus.  Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective 
contraception during treatment with IBRANCE and for at least 3 weeks after the last dose [see Use in 
Specific Populations (8.1 and 8.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)].

ADVERSE REACTIONS 
 
The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: 
• Neutropenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] 
• ILD/Pneumonitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] 
 
6.1 
Clinical Studies Experience 
 
Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in 
the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and 
may not reflect the rates observed in practice. 
 
PALOMA-2: IBRANCE plus Letrozole 
 
Patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer for 
initial endocrine-based therapy 
 
The safety of IBRANCE (125 mg/day) plus letrozole (2.5 mg/day) versus placebo plus letrozole was 
evaluated in PALOMA-2.  The data described below reflect exposure to IBRANCE in 444 out of 
666 patients with ER-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who received at least 1 dose of 
IBRANCE plus letrozole in PALOMA-2.  The median duration of treatment for IBRANCE plus 
letrozole was 19.8 months while the median duration of treatment for placebo plus letrozole arm was 
13.8 months. 
 
Dose reductions due to an adverse reaction of any grade occurred in 36% of patients receiving 
IBRANCE plus letrozole.  No dose reduction was allowed for letrozole in PALOMA-2. 
 
Permanent discontinuation associated with an adverse reaction occurred in 43 of 444 (10%) patients 
receiving IBRANCE plus letrozole and in 13 of 222 (6%) patients receiving placebo plus letrozole.  
Adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation for patients receiving IBRANCE plus letrozole 
included neutropenia (1.1%) and alanine aminotransferase increase (0.7%). 
 
The most common adverse reactions (≥10%) of any grade reported in patients in the IBRANCE plus 
letrozole arm by descending frequency were neutropenia, infections, leukopenia, fatigue, nausea, 
alopecia, stomatitis, diarrhea, anemia, rash, asthenia, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, decreased appetite, 
dry skin, pyrexia, and dysgeusia.  
 
The most frequently reported Grade >3 adverse reactions (≥5%) in patients receiving IBRANCE plus 
letrozole by descending frequency were neutropenia, leukopenia, infections, and anemia. 
 
Adverse reactions (≥10%) reported in patients who received IBRANCE plus letrozole or placebo plus 
letrozole in PALOMA-2 are listed in Table 4.

PALOMA-3: IBRANCE plus Fulvestrant 
 
Patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have had disease 
progression on or after prior adjuvant or metastatic endocrine therapy 
 
The safety of IBRANCE (125 mg/day) plus fulvestrant (500 mg) versus placebo plus fulvestrant was 
evaluated in PALOMA-3.  The data described below reflect exposure to IBRANCE in 345 out of 
517 patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer who received at 
least 1 dose of IBRANCE plus fulvestrant in PALOMA-3.  The median duration of treatment for 
IBRANCE plus fulvestrant was 10.8 months while the median duration of treatment for placebo plus 
fulvestrant arm was 4.8 months. 
 
Dose reductions due to an adverse reaction of any grade occurred in 36% of patients receiving 
IBRANCE plus fulvestrant.  No dose reduction was allowed for fulvestrant in PALOMA-3. 
 
Permanent discontinuation associated with an adverse reaction occurred in 19 of 345 (6%) patients 
receiving IBRANCE plus fulvestrant, and in 6 of 172 (3%) patients receiving placebo plus fulvestrant.  
Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation for those patients receiving IBRANCE plus fulvestrant 
included fatigue (0.6%), infections (0.6%), and thrombocytopenia (0.6%). 
 
The most common adverse reactions (≥10%) of any grade reported in patients in the IBRANCE plus 
fulvestrant arm by descending frequency were neutropenia, leukopenia, infections, fatigue, nausea, 
anemia, stomatitis, diarrhea, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, alopecia, rash, decreased appetite, and 
pyrexia.  
 
The most frequently reported Grade ≥3 adverse reactions (≥5%) in patients receiving IBRANCE plus 
fulvestrant in descending frequency were neutropenia and leukopenia.

INAVO120: IBRANCE plus Inavolisib and Fulvestrant 
 
Adults with PIK3CA-mutated, HR-positive, HER2-negative, locally advanced or metastatic breast 
cancer whose disease progressed during or within 12 months of completing adjuvant endocrine therapy 
and who have not received prior systemic therapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease 
 
The safety of the combination of IBRANCE plus inavolisib and fulvestrant was evaluated in a 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (INAVO120) in 324 patients with PIK3CA-mutated, 
HR-positive, HER2-negative, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer [see Clinical Studies (14)].  
 
Patients received either IBRANCE 125 mg orally once daily for 21 consecutive days followed by 7 days 
off treatment to comprise a cycle of 28 days plus fulvestrant in combination with inavolisib (n=162) or 
placebo (n=162). The median duration of treatment for IBRANCE plus inavolisib and fulvestrant was 9 
months (range: 0 to 39 months).  
 
Serious adverse reactions occurred in 24% of patients who received IBRANCE plus inavolisib and 
fulvestrant. Serious adverse reactions occurring in ≥1% of patients receiving IBRANCE plus inavolisib 
and fulvestrant included anemia (1.9%), diarrhea (1.2%), and urinary tract infection (1.2%).  
 
Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 3.7% of patients who received IBRANCE plus inavolisib and 
fulvestrant, including (0.6% each) acute coronary syndrome, cerebral hemorrhage, cerebrovascular 
accident, COVID-19 infection, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage.  
 
Permanent discontinuation of IBRANCE associated with an adverse reaction occurred in 8 of 162 
(4.9%) patients receiving IBRANCE plus inavolisib and fulvestrant and in 0 of 162 patients receiving 
IBRANCE plus placebo and fulvestrant. Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of IBRANCE in 
patients receiving IBRANCE plus inavolisib and fulvestrant were neutropenia, infections, alanine 
aminotransferase increased, gastric ulcer, intestinal perforation, hyperglycemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, 
bone pain, musculoskeletal pain, transitional cell carcinoma, and acute kidney injury (0.6% each). 
 
Dose reduction of IBRANCE due to an adverse reaction occurred in 38% of patients receiving 
IBRANCE plus inavolisib and fulvestrant and in 30% of patients receiving IBRANCE plus placebo and 
fulvestrant. Adverse reactions leading to dose reductions of IBRANCE in ≥2% patients receiving 
IBRANCE plus inavolisib and fulvestrant were neutropenia (30%), leukopenia (6%), and 
thrombocytopenia (3.7%).

DRUG INTERACTIONS  
 
Palbociclib is primarily metabolized by CYP3A and sulfotransferase (SULT) enzyme SULT2A1.  
In vivo, palbociclib is a time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A. 
 
7.1 
Agents That May Increase Palbociclib Plasma Concentrations 
 
Effect of CYP3A Inhibitors 
 
Coadministration of a strong CYP3A inhibitor (itraconazole) increased the plasma exposure of 
palbociclib in healthy subjects by 87%.  Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors 
(e.g., clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, lopinavir/ritonavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, 
posaconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, telithromycin, and voriconazole).  Avoid grapefruit or 
grapefruit juice during IBRANCE treatment.  If coadministration of IBRANCE with a strong CYP3A 
inhibitor cannot be avoided, reduce the dose of IBRANCE [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and 
Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 
 
7.2 
Agents That May Decrease Palbociclib Plasma Concentrations 
 
Effect of CYP3A Inducers 
 
Coadministration of a strong CYP3A inducer (rifampin) decreased the plasma exposure of palbociclib in 
healthy subjects by 85%.  Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A inducers (e.g., phenytoin, rifampin, 
carbamazepine, enzalutamide, and St John’s Wort) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 
 
7.3 
Drugs That May Have Their Plasma Concentrations Altered by Palbociclib 
 
Coadministration of midazolam with multiple doses of IBRANCE increased the midazolam plasma 
exposure by 61%, in healthy subjects, compared to administration of midazolam alone.  The dose of the 
sensitive CYP3A substrate with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., alfentanil, cyclosporine, 
dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, everolimus, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, and tacrolimus) 
may need to be reduced, as IBRANCE may increase its exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 
 
8.1 
Pregnancy 
 
Risk Summary 
 
Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, IBRANCE can cause fetal harm 
when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)].  There are no available 
data in pregnant women to inform the drug-associated risk.  In animal reproduction studies, 
administration of palbociclib to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis resulted in embryo-fetal 
Viewed on: Wednesday, July 16, 2025 - 6:31:25 PM Eastern Time


14 
toxicity at maternal exposures that were 4 times the human clinical exposure based on AUC 
(see Data).  Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. 
 
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is 
unknown.  In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and 
miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2%-4% and 15%-20%, respectively.  
 
Data 
 
Animal Data 
 
In a fertility and early embryonic development study in female rats, palbociclib was administered orally 
for 15 days before mating through to Day 7 of pregnancy, which did not cause embryo toxicity at doses 
up to 300 mg/kg/day with maternal systemic exposures approximately 4 times the human exposure 
(AUC) at the recommended dose. 
 
In embryo-fetal development studies in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received oral doses of 
palbociclib up to 300 mg/kg/day and 20 mg/kg/day, respectively, during the period of organogenesis.  
The maternally toxic dose of 300 mg/kg/day was fetotoxic in rats, resulting in reduced fetal body 
weights.  At doses ≥100 mg/kg/day in rats, there was an increased incidence of a skeletal variation 
(increased incidence of a rib present at the seventh cervical vertebra).  At the maternally toxic dose of 
20 mg/kg/day in rabbits, there was an increased incidence of skeletal variations, including small 
phalanges in the forelimb.  At 300 mg/kg/day in rats and 20 mg/kg/day in rabbits, the maternal systemic 
exposures were approximately 4 and 9 times the human exposure (AUC) at the recommended dose, 
respectively. 
 
CDK4/6 double knockout mice have been reported to die in late stages of fetal development (gestation 
Day 14.5 until birth) due to severe anemia.  However, knockout mouse data may not be predictive of 
effects in humans due to differences in degree of target inhibition. 
 
8.2 
Lactation 
 
Risk Summary 
 
There is no information regarding the presence of palbociclib in human milk, its effects on milk 
production, or the breastfed infant.  Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed 
infants from IBRANCE, advise a lactating woman not to breastfeed during treatment with IBRANCE 
and for 3 weeks after the last dose.

8.3 
Females and Males of Reproductive Potential 
 
Pregnancy Testing 
 
Based on animal studies, IBRANCE can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see 
Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].  Females of reproductive potential should have a pregnancy test prior 
to starting treatment with IBRANCE. 
 
Contraception 
 
Females 
 
IBRANCE can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific 
Populations (8.1)].  Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during 
treatment with IBRANCE and for at least 3 weeks after the last dose. 
 
Males 
 
Because of the potential for genotoxicity, advise male patients with female partners of reproductive 
potential to use effective contraception during treatment with IBRANCE and for 3 months after the last 
dose [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. 
 
Infertility 
 
Males 
 
Based on animal studies, IBRANCE may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential [see 
Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. 
 
8.4 
Pediatric Use 
 
The safety and efficacy of IBRANCE in pediatric patients have not been studied. 
 
Altered glucose metabolism (glycosuria, hyperglycemia, decreased insulin) associated with changes in 
the pancreas (islet cell vacuolation), eye (cataracts, lens degeneration), kidney (tubule vacuolation, 
chronic progressive nephropathy) and adipose tissue (atrophy) were identified in a 27 week repeat-dose 
toxicology study in rats that were immature at the beginning of the studies and were most prevalent in 
males at oral palbociclib doses ≥30 mg/kg/day (approximately 11 times the adult human exposure 
[AUC] at the recommended dose).  Some of these findings (glycosuria/hyperglycemia, pancreatic islet 
cell vacuolation, and kidney tubule vacuolation) were present with lower incidence and severity in a 
15 week repeat-dose toxicology study in immature rats.  Altered glucose metabolism or associated 
changes in the pancreas, eye, kidney and adipose tissue were not identified in a 27-week repeat-dose 
toxicology study in rats that were mature at the beginning of the study and in dogs in repeat-dose 
toxicology studies up to 39 weeks duration.  
 
Toxicities in teeth independent of altered glucose metabolism were observed in rats.  Administration of 
100 mg/kg palbociclib for 27 weeks (approximately 15 times the adult human exposure [AUC] at the 
recommended dose) resulted in abnormalities in growing incisor teeth (discolored, ameloblast 
degeneration/necrosis, mononuclear cell infiltrate).  Other toxicities of potential concern to pediatric 
patients have not been evaluated in juvenile animals.

8.5 
Geriatric Use 
 
Of 444 patients who received IBRANCE in PALOMA-2, 181 patients (41%) were ≥65 years of age and 
48 patients (11%) were ≥75 years of age.  Of 347 patients who received IBRANCE in PALOMA-3, 
86 patients (25%) were ≥65 years of age and 27 patients (8%) were ≥75 years of age.  No overall 
differences in safety or effectiveness of IBRANCE were observed between these patients and younger 
patients. 
 
8.6 
Hepatic Impairment 
 
No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh 
classes A and B).  For patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C), the recommended 
dose of IBRANCE is 75 mg once daily for 21 consecutive days followed by 7 days off treatment to 
comprise a complete cycle of 28 days [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].  Based on a 
pharmacokinetic trial in subjects with varying degrees of hepatic function, the palbociclib unbound 
exposure (unbound AUCINF) decreased by 17% in subjects with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh 
class A), and increased by 34% and 77% in subjects with moderate (Child-Pugh class B) and severe 
(Child-Pugh class C) hepatic impairment, respectively, relative to subjects with normal hepatic function.  
Peak palbociclib unbound exposure (unbound Cmax) increased by 7%, 38% and 72% for mild, moderate 
and severe hepatic impairment, respectively, relative to subjects with normal hepatic function [see 
Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.7 
Renal Impairment 
 
No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment 
(CrCl >15 mL/min).   
 
Based on a pharmacokinetic trial in subjects with varying degrees of renal function, the total palbociclib 
exposure (AUCINF) increased by 39%, 42%, and 31% with mild (60 mL/min ≤ CrCl <90 mL/min), 
moderate (30 mL/min ≤ CrCl <60 mL/min), and severe (CrCl <30 mL/min) renal impairment, 
respectively, relative to subjects with normal renal function.  Peak palbociclib exposure (Cmax) increased 
by 17%, 12%, and 15% for mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively, relative to 
subjects with normal renal function.   
 
The pharmacokinetics of palbociclib have not been studied in patients requiring hemodialysis [see 
Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 
 
12.1 
Mechanism of Action 
 
Palbociclib is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) 4 and 6.  Cyclin D1 and CDK4/6 are 
downstream of signaling pathways which lead to cellular proliferation.  In vitro, palbociclib reduced 
cellular proliferation of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer cell lines by blocking progression 
of the cell from G1 into S phase of the cell cycle.  Treatment of breast cancer cell lines with the 
combination of palbociclib and antiestrogens leads to decreased retinoblastoma (Rb) protein 
phosphorylation resulting in reduced E2F expression and signaling, and increased growth arrest 
compared to treatment with each drug alone.  In vitro treatment of ER-positive breast cancer cell lines 
with the combination of palbociclib and antiestrogens led to increased cell senescence compared to each 
drug alone, which was sustained for up to 6 days following palbociclib removal and was greater if 
antiestrogen treatment was continued.  In vivo studies using a patient-derived ER-positive breast cancer 
xenograft model demonstrated that the combination of palbociclib and letrozole increased the inhibition 
of Rb phosphorylation, downstream signaling, and tumor growth compared to each drug alone. 
 
Human bone marrow mononuclear cells treated with palbociclib in the presence or absence of an 
anti-estrogen in vitro did not become senescent and resumed proliferation following palbociclib 
withdrawal.   
12.2 
Pharmacodynamics 
 
Cardiac Electrophysiology 
 
The effect of palbociclib on the QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) was evaluated using 
time-matched electrocardiograms (ECGs) evaluating the change from baseline and corresponding 
pharmacokinetic data in 77 patients with breast cancer.  Palbociclib had no large effect on QTc 
(i.e., >20 ms) at 125 mg once daily for 21 consecutive days followed by 7 days off treatment to comprise 
a complete cycle of 28 days.

12.3 
Pharmacokinetics 
 
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of palbociclib were characterized in patients with solid tumors including 
advanced breast cancer and in healthy subjects. 
 
Absorption 
 
The maximum observed concentration (Cmax) of palbociclib is generally observed between 4 to 12 hours 
(time to reach maximum concentration, Tmax) following oral administration of IBRANCE tablets.  The 
mean absolute bioavailability of IBRANCE after an oral 125 mg dose is 46%.  In the dosing range of 
25 mg to 225 mg, the AUC and Cmax increased proportionally with dose in general.  Steady state was 
achieved within 8 days following repeated once daily dosing.  With repeated once daily administration, 
palbociclib accumulated with a median accumulation ratio of 2.4 (range 1.5 to 4.2).  
 
Food Effect: The area under the concentration-time curve from zero to infinity (AUCINF) and Cmax of 
palbociclib increased by 22% and 26%, respectively, when IBRANCE tablets were given with a 
high-fat, high-calorie meal (approximately 800 to 1000 calories with 150, 250, and 500 to 600 calories 
from protein, carbohydrate, and fat, respectively), and by 9% and 10%, respectively, when IBRANCE 
tablets were given with a moderate-fat, standard-calorie meal (approximately 500 to 700 calories with 
75 to 105, 250 to 350 and 175 to 245 calories from protein, carbohydrate, and fat, respectively), 
compared to IBRANCE tablets given under overnight fasted conditions.  
 
Distribution 
 
Binding of palbociclib to human plasma proteins in vitro was approximately 85%, with no concentration 
dependence over the concentration range of 500 ng/mL to 5000 ng/mL.  The mean fraction unbound (fu) 
of palbociclib in human plasma in vivo increased incrementally with worsening hepatic function.  There 
was no obvious trend in the mean palbociclib fu in human plasma in vivo with worsening renal function.  
The geometric mean apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) was 2583 L with a coefficient of variation 
(CV) of 26%. 
 
Metabolism 
 
In vitro and in vivo studies indicated that palbociclib undergoes hepatic metabolism in humans.  
Following oral administration of a single 125 mg dose of [14C]palbociclib to humans, the primary 
metabolic pathways for palbociclib involved oxidation and sulfonation, with acylation and 
glucuronidation contributing as minor pathways.  Palbociclib was the major circulating drug-derived 
entity in plasma (23%).  The major circulating metabolite was a glucuronide conjugate of palbociclib, 
although it only represented 1.5% of the administered dose in the excreta.  Palbociclib was extensively 
metabolized with unchanged drug accounting for 2.3% and 6.9% of radioactivity in feces and urine, 
respectively.  In feces, the sulfamic acid conjugate of palbociclib was the major drug-related component, 
accounting for 26% of the administered dose.  In vitro studies with human hepatocytes, liver cytosolic 
and S9 fractions, and recombinant SULT enzymes indicated that CYP3A and SULT2A1 are mainly 
involved in the metabolism of palbociclib. 
 
Elimination 
 
The geometric mean apparent oral clearance (CL/F) of palbociclib was 63.1 L/hr (29% CV), and the 
mean (± standard deviation) plasma elimination half-life was 29 (±5) hours in patients with advanced 
breast cancer.  In 6 healthy male subjects given a single oral dose of [14C] palbociclib, a median of 
91.6% of the total administered radioactive dose was recovered in 15 days; feces (74.1% of dose) was

the major route of excretion, with 17.5% of the dose recovered in urine.  The majority of the material 
was excreted as metabolites. 
 
Specific Populations 
 
Age, Gender, and Body Weight 
 
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis in 183 patients with cancer (50 male and 133 female 
patients, age range from 22 to 89 years, and body weight range from 37.9 to 123 kg), gender had no 
effect on the exposure of palbociclib, and age and body weight had no clinically important effect on the 
exposure of palbociclib. 
 
Pediatric Population 
 
Pharmacokinetics of IBRANCE have not been evaluated in patients <18 years of age. 
 
Hepatic Impairment 
 
Data from a pharmacokinetic trial in subjects with varying degrees of hepatic impairment indicate that 
palbociclib unbound AUCINF decreased 17% in subjects with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh 
class A), and increased by 34% and 77% in subjects with moderate (Child-Pugh class B) and severe 
(Child-Pugh class C) hepatic impairment, respectively, relative to subjects with normal hepatic function.  
Palbociclib unbound Cmax increased by 7%, 38% and 72% for mild, moderate and severe hepatic 
impairment, respectively, relative to subjects with normal hepatic function.  In addition, based on a 
population pharmacokinetic analysis that included 183 patients, where 40 patients had mild hepatic 
impairment based on National Cancer Institute (NCI) classification (total bilirubin ≤ ULN and 
AST > ULN, or total bilirubin >1.0 to 1.5 × ULN and any AST), mild hepatic impairment had no effect 
on the exposure of palbociclib, further supporting the findings from the dedicated hepatic impairment 
study. 
 
Renal Impairment 
 
Data from a pharmacokinetic trial in subjects with varying degrees of renal impairment indicate that 
palbociclib AUCINF increased by 39%, 42%, and 31% with mild (60 mL/min ≤ CrCl <90 mL/min), 
moderate (30 mL/min ≤ CrCl <60 mL/min), and severe (CrCl <30 mL/min) renal impairment, 
respectively, relative to subjects with normal renal function.  Peak palbociclib exposure (Cmax) increased 
by 17%, 12%, and 15% for mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively, relative to 
subjects with normal renal function.  In addition, based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis that 
included 183 patients where 73 patients had mild renal impairment and 29 patients had moderate renal 
impairment, mild and moderate renal impairment had no effect on the exposure of palbociclib.  The 
pharmacokinetics of palbociclib have not been studied in patients requiring hemodialysis. 
 
Drug Interactions 
 
In vitro data indicate that CYP3A and SULT enzyme SULT2A1 are mainly involved in the metabolism 
of palbociclib.  Palbociclib is a weak time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A following daily 125 mg dosing 
to steady state in humans.  In vitro, palbociclib is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 
2C19, and 2D6, and is not an inducer of CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, and 3A4 at clinically relevant 
concentrations. 
 
Viewed on: Wednesday, July 16, 2025 - 6:31:25 PM Eastern Time


20 
CYP3A Inhibitors: Data from a drug interaction trial in healthy subjects (N=12) indicate that 
coadministration of multiple 200 mg daily doses of itraconazole with a single 125 mg IBRANCE dose 
increased palbociclib AUCINF and the Cmax by approximately 87% and 34%, respectively, relative to a 
single 125 mg IBRANCE dose given alone [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. 
 
CYP3A Inducers: Data from a drug interaction trial in healthy subjects (N=15) indicate that 
coadministration of multiple 600 mg daily doses of rifampin, a strong CYP3A inducer, with a single 
125 mg IBRANCE dose decreased palbociclib AUCINF and Cmax by 85% and 70%, respectively, relative 
to a single 125 mg IBRANCE dose given alone.  Data from a drug interaction trial in healthy subjects 
(N=14) indicate that coadministration of multiple 400 mg daily doses of modafinil, a moderate 
CYP3A inducer, with a single 125 mg IBRANCE dose decreased palbociclib AUCINF and Cmax by 32% 
and 11%, respectively, relative to a single 125 mg IBRANCE dose given alone [see Drug Interactions 
(7.2)]. 
 
CYP3A Substrates: Palbociclib is a weak time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A following daily 125 mg 
dosing to steady state in humans.  In a drug interaction trial in healthy subjects (N=26), 
coadministration of midazolam with multiple doses of IBRANCE increased the midazolam AUCINF and 
the Cmax values by 61% and 37%, respectively, as compared to administration of midazolam alone 
[see Drug Interactions (7.3)]. 
 
Gastric pH Elevating Medications: In a drug interaction trial in healthy subjects, coadministration of a 
single 125 mg IBRANCE tablet with multiple doses of the proton pump inhibitor (PPI) rabeprazole 
under overnight fasted conditions had no effect on the rate and extent of absorption of palbociclib when 
compared to a single 125 mg IBRANCE tablet administered alone.  Given the reduced effect on 
gastric pH of H2-receptor antagonists and local antacids compared to PPIs, an effect of these classes of 
acid reducing agents on palbociclib exposure is not expected.  
 
Effect of Palbociclib on Transporters: In vitro evaluations indicated that palbociclib has a low potential 
to inhibit the activities of drug transporters organic anion transporter (OAT)1, OAT3, organic cation 
transporter (OCT)2, and organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1, OATP1B3 at clinically 
relevant concentrations.  In vitro, palbociclib has the potential to inhibit OCT1 at clinically relevant 
concentrations, as well as the potential to inhibit P-glycoprotein (P-gp) or breast cancer resistance 
protein (BCRP) in the gastrointestinal tract at the proposed dose. 
 
Effect of Transporters on Palbociclib: Based on in vitro data, P-gp and BCRP mediated transport are 
unlikely to affect the extent of oral absorption of palbociclib at therapeutic doses.

NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 
 
13.1 
Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility 
 
Palbociclib was assessed for carcinogenicity in a 6-month transgenic mouse study and in a 2-year rat 
study.  Oral administration of palbociclib for 2 years resulted in an increased incidence of microglial cell 
tumors in the central nervous system of male rats at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 8 times the 
human clinical exposure based on AUC).  There were no neoplastic findings in female rats at doses up 
to 200 mg/kg/day (approximately 5 times the human clinical exposure based on AUC).  Oral 
administration of palbociclib to male and female rasH2 transgenic mice for 6 months did not result in 
increased incidence of neoplasms at doses up to 60 mg/kg/day. 
 
Palbociclib was aneugenic in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells in vitro and in the bone marrow of male rats 
at doses ≥100 mg/kg/day for 3 weeks.  Palbociclib was not mutagenic in an in vitro bacterial reverse

21 
mutation (Ames) assay and was not clastogenic in the in vitro human lymphocyte chromosome 
aberration assay. 
 
In a fertility study in female rats, palbociclib did not affect mating or fertility at any dose up to 
300 mg/kg/day (approximately 4 times human clinical exposure based on AUC) and no adverse effects 
were observed in the female reproductive tissues in repeat-dose toxicity studies up to 300 mg/kg/day in 
the rat and 3 mg/kg/day in the dog (approximately 6 times and similar to human exposure [AUC], at the 
recommended dose, respectively). 
 
The adverse effects of palbociclib on male reproductive function and fertility were observed in the 
repeat-dose toxicology studies in rats and dogs and a male fertility study in rats.  In repeat-dose 
toxicology studies, palbociclib-related findings in the testis, epididymis, prostate, and seminal vesicle at 
≥30 mg/kg/day in rats and ≥0.2 mg/kg/day in dogs included decreased organ weight, atrophy or 
degeneration, hypospermia, intratubular cellular debris, and decreased secretion.  Partial reversibility of 
male reproductive organ effects was observed in the rat and dog following a 4- and 12-week non-dosing 
period, respectively.  These doses in rats and dogs resulted in approximately ≥10 and 0.1 times, 
respectively, the exposure [AUC] in humans at the recommended dose.  In the fertility and early 
embryonic development study in male rats, palbociclib caused no effects on mating but resulted in a 
slight decrease in fertility in association with lower sperm motility and density at 100 mg/kg/day with 
projected exposure levels [AUC] of 20 times the exposure in humans at the recommended dose.

CLINICAL STUDIES 
 
PALOMA-2: IBRANCE plus Letrozole 
 
Patients with ER-positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer for initial 
endocrine-based therapy 
 
PALOMA-2 was an international, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter study of 
IBRANCE plus letrozole versus placebo plus letrozole conducted in postmenopausal women with 
ER-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who had not received previous systemic treatment 
for their advanced disease.  A total of 666 patients were randomized 2:1 to IBRANCE plus letrozole or 
placebo plus letrozole.  Randomization was stratified by disease site (visceral versus non-visceral), 
disease-free interval (de novo metastatic versus ≤12 months from the end of adjuvant treatment to 
disease recurrence versus >12 months from the end of adjuvant treatment to disease recurrence), and 
nature of prior (neo)adjuvant anticancer therapies (prior hormonal therapies versus no prior hormonal 
therapy).  IBRANCE was given orally at a dose of 125 mg daily for 21 consecutive days followed by 
7 days off treatment.  Patients received study treatment until objective disease progression, symptomatic 
deterioration, unacceptable toxicity, death, or withdrawal of consent, whichever occurred first.  The 
major efficacy outcome of the study was investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) evaluated 
according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST).  Additional efficacy 
outcome measures were confirmed overall response rate (ORR) as assessed by the investigator 
according to RECIST Version 1.1 and overall survival (OS). 
 
Patients enrolled in this study had a median age of 62 years (range 28 to 89).  The majority of patients 
were White (78%), and most patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 
performance status (PS) of 0 or 1 (98%).  Forty-eight percent of patients had received chemotherapy and 
56% had received antihormonal therapy in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting prior to their diagnosis of 
advanced breast cancer.  Thirty-seven percent of patients had no prior systemic therapy in the 
neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting.  The majority of patients (97%) had metastatic disease.  Twenty-three 
percent of patients had bone only disease, and 49% of patients had visceral disease.

Major efficacy results from PALOMA-2 are summarized in Table 10 and Figure 1.  Consistent results 
were observed across patient subgroups of disease-free interval (DFI), disease site, and prior therapy.  
The treatment effect of the combination on PFS was also supported by an independent review of 
radiographs.  Based on the prespecified final OS analysis conducted after 435 events, OS was not 
statistically significant.

PALOMA-3: IBRANCE plus Fulvestrant 
 
Patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have had disease 
progression on or after prior adjuvant or metastatic endocrine-therapy 
 
PALOMA-3 was an international, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter study of 
IBRANCE plus fulvestrant versus placebo plus fulvestrant conducted in women with HR-positive, 
HER2-negative advanced breast cancer, regardless of their menopausal status, whose disease progressed 
on or after prior endocrine therapy.  A total of 521 pre/postmenopausal women were randomized 2:1 to 
IBRANCE plus fulvestrant or placebo plus fulvestrant and stratified by documented sensitivity to prior 
hormonal therapy, menopausal status at study entry (pre/peri versus postmenopausal), and presence of 
visceral metastases.  IBRANCE was given orally at a dose of 125 mg daily for 21 consecutive days 
followed by 7 days off treatment.  Pre/perimenopausal women were enrolled in the study and received 
the LHRH agonist goserelin for at least 4 weeks prior to and for the duration of PALOMA-3.  Patients 
continued to receive assigned treatment until objective disease progression, symptomatic deterioration, 
unacceptable toxicity, death, or withdrawal of consent, whichever occurred first.  The major efficacy 
outcome of the study was investigator-assessed PFS evaluated according to RECIST 1.1. 
 
Patients enrolled in this study had a median age of 57 years (range 29 to 88).  The majority of patients 
on study were White (74%), all patients had an ECOG PS of 0 or 1, and 80% were postmenopausal.  All 
patients had received prior systemic therapy, and 75% of patients had received a previous chemotherapy 
regimen.  Twenty-five percent of patients had received no prior therapy in the metastatic disease setting, 
60% had visceral metastases, and 23% had bone only disease. 
 
The results from the investigator-assessed PFS and final OS from PALOMA-3 are summarized in 
Table 11.  The relevant Kaplan-Meier plots are shown in Figures 2 and 3, respectively.  Consistent PFS 
results were observed across patient subgroups of disease site, sensitivity to prior hormonal therapy, and

INAVO120: IBRANCE plus Inavolisib and Fulvestrant 
 
Adults with PIK3CA-mutated, HR-positive, HER2-negative, locally advanced or metastatic breast 
cancer whose disease progressed during or within 12 months of completing adjuvant endocrine therapy 
and who have not received prior systemic therapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease 
 
INAVO120 (NCT04191499) was a randomized (1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating 
the efficacy of inavolisib in combination with IBRANCE and fulvestrant in adult patients with 
endocrine-resistant PIK3CA-mutated, HR-positive, HER2-negative (defined as IHC 0 or 1+, or IHC 
2+/ISH-), locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer whose disease progressed during or within 12 
months of completing adjuvant endocrine therapy and who have not received prior systemic therapy for 
locally advanced or metastatic disease. Randomization was stratified by presence of visceral disease (yes 
or no), endocrine resistance (primary or secondary), and geographic region (North America/Western 
Europe, Asia, other).  
 
Primary endocrine resistance was defined as relapse while on the first 2 years of adjuvant endocrine 
therapy (ET) and secondary endocrine resistance was defined as relapse while on adjuvant ET after at 
least 2 years or relapse within 12 months of completing adjuvant ET.  
 
Patients were required to have a HbA1C <6% and fasting blood glucose <126 mg/dL. The study excluded 
patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus or Type 2 diabetes mellitus requiring ongoing anti-hyperglycemic 
treatment at the start of study treatment.  
 
PIK3CA mutation status was prospectively determined in a central laboratory using the FoundationOne® 
Liquid CDx assay on plasma-derived circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) or in local laboratories using 
various validated polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or next-generation sequencing (NGS) assays on 
tumor tissue or plasma. All patients were required to provide both a freshly collected pre-treatment

blood sample and a tumor tissue sample for central evaluation and determination of PIK3CA mutation(s) 
status. 
 
Patients received either inavolisib 9 mg (n=161) or placebo (n=164) orally once daily, in combination 
with IBRANCE 125 mg orally once daily for 21 consecutive days followed by 7 days off treatment to 
comprise a cycle of 28 days, and fulvestrant 500 mg administered intramuscularly on Cycle 1, Days 1 
and 15, and then on Day 1 of every 28-day cycle. Patients received treatment until disease progression 
or unacceptable toxicity. In addition, all pre/perimenopausal women and men received an LHRH agonist 
throughout therapy.  
 
The baseline demographic and disease characteristics were: median age 54 years (range: 27 to 79 years); 
98% female, of which 39% were pre/perimenopausal; 59% White, 38% Asian, 2.5% Unknown, 0.6% 
Black or African American; 6% Hispanic or Latino; and ECOG PS of 0 (63%) or 1 (36%). Tamoxifen 
(57%) and aromatase inhibitors (50%) were the most commonly used adjuvant endocrine therapies. 
Sixty-four percent of patients were considered to have secondary endocrine resistance. Eighty-three 
percent of patients had received prior chemotherapy (in the neo/adjuvant setting) and 1.2% of patients 
had been treated with a CDK4/6 inhibitor. 
 
The major efficacy outcome measure was investigator (INV)-assessed PFS per RECIST version 1.1. 
Additional efficacy outcome measures included OS, INV-assessed ORR, and INV-assessed duration of 
response (DOR).  
 
Efficacy results are summarized in Table 12 and Figure 4. INV-assessed PFS results were supported by 
consistent results from a blinded independent central review (BICR) assessment. At the time of the PFS 
analysis, OS data were not mature with 30% deaths in the overall population.
